I understand you've provided the technical specifications for a Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Radix UI components, Lucide React icons, React Hook Form with Zod validation, Next.js Image optimization, and Google Fonts.

However, I don't see a specific request for what you'd like me to build. Could you please tell me what kind of application, component, or feature you'd like me to create using these technologies?

For example:
- A landing page
- A dashboard
- A form component
- An e-commerce product page
- A blog layout
- Or any other specific functionality

Once you provide the details of what you want to build, I'll create the complete, production-ready code using the specifications you've outlined.
